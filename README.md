# cell_counter
This program detects heterogenous droplets and subsequently determines if the droplet contains a cell or not. 
A lower accuracy version is fully functional in the file 'Cell Lysis Analyzer_1.1.py', but isn't very tolerant of droplet heterogeniety.

The neural network version will be more tolerant, but is on hold till the encapsulation project shows more promise.
